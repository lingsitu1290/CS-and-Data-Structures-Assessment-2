RECURSION:

1. Recursion is function that calls itself. 
2. Base case is required for the recursion function to know when to stop running. Without a base case, the function will run indefinitely. 

GRAPH:
1. Graphs are trees that contain loops. And relations between nodes can be directed or non-directed.
2. Trees are acyclic and directed. Whereas graphs can be acyclic or cyclic and directed or non-directed. 
3. Social networks showing who is connected to who.

SORTING: 
1. Bubble Sort algorithm compares adjacent numbers two at a time and floating the larger number to the right.
2. Merge Sort algorithm starts with two sorted lists. Merged into a new list by comparing the first element of each sorted list and appending to the new list the lowest number until the both the lists are empty. 
3. Quick Sort algorithm partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the resulting two subarray.

GIT BRANCHING:
1. Using git branching is useful while working in teams. Each branch can be for one team and when work is ready for release, it can be merged with the master.
2. Pull request is a request for a user to another user's repository to one's contribute code to another user's repository.
